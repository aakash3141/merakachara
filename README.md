# Welcome to my website (merakachara)!
Idk what I am doing but at least I'm having fun.<br><br>
If you want you can check out the autoclicker and perfect-circle drawing thingys I made.<br>
You can also check out a little tutorial I made on the weird-ish Windows API.<br><br>
I sure as hell have been having fun making this; I hope you will have fun looking at all my stuff...

## My website name
The name is very fitting, since I am putting up my trash at this point.<br>
"Mera kachara" is Hindi for "my trash"; it's the second name I came up with (first name was "miscellaneous", but that was boring).

But who knows? One man's trash is another man's treasure as they say...
